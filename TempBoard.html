									<h1>Custom Tempreture Board</h1>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/tempreture board schmeatic cropped.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This project was specifically developed for the Northwestern 
									Formula SAE 2023 electric car. With the transition to an all-electric vehicle this year, 
									it became crucial to devise a reliable temperature monitoring system to provide real-time data 
									to both the driver and the team. This board utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller, which 
									efficiently records and transmits information through the CANBUS protocol. To accurately capture 
									the ambient temperature at various points on the car, two NTC thermistors have been strategically 
									placed. Additionally, a waterproof NTC thermistor is incorporated to precisely measure the coolant 
									temperature. 
									The board is further equipped with a flow rate sensor to monitor the coolant flow. </p>
